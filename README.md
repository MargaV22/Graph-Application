# School Network Manager

INTRODUCTION 

The School Network Manager is a Java console-based application that uses a Graph Structure to represent and manage connections between various school entities such as classrooms, departments, teachers, or clubs. It models relationships in the school as a graph where nodes represent entities and edges represent collaborations or connections.

WHAT IT CAN DO?
1. Add Entity (Node): Add new entities such as classrooms, teachers, or departments to the network.
2. Connect Entities (Edge): Create connections between entities, representing relationships or collaborations.
3. Display Network: Visualize the entire school network by showing all nodes and their connections.
4. Check Connection: Verify if a path exists between two entities, indicating whether they are connected directly or indirectly.

WHY THIS APPLICATION?
1. Practical Use Case: Schools often involve complex relationships and collaborations, such as between teachers, students, and departments. This application models these relationships in a manageable way.
2. Educational Purpose: Demonstrates the use of graph structures in a real-world scenario while providing a hands-on experience for understanding nodes, edges, and pathfinding.
3. Foundation for Expansion: Can be expanded into a fully-featured school management system that handles scheduling, resource allocation, or inter-department communication.

WHAT DOES IT CONTRIBUTE?
1. Improved Collaboration: Helps schools understand and optimize their internal connections and collaboration networks.
2. Educational Tool: Introduces the concept of graphs in a practical and relatable manner, aiding students and developers.
3. Scalable Solution: Serves as the foundation for creating more advanced systems that model complex relationships.
